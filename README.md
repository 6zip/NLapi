# NLapi
The NLapi - API system made entirely in Lua!

The NLapi only uses two luarocks modules.

* luasocket

* dkjson

The NLapi has only been tested with **Lua 5.1!**

*It is unconfirmed by me* if this will work with any previous/further versions of Lua.

Contributing and forking is completely fine as long as credit is given!
