# NLapi
The NLapi - API system made entirely in Lua!

The NLapi only uses two luarocks modules.

* luasocket

* dkjson

The NLapi has only been tested with **Lua 5.1!**

It is unconfirmed by me if this will work with and previous/further version of Lua.

Open an issue if you experience or discover any bugs please.

Contributions, forking, and pulling is completely fine as long as needed credit is given!
